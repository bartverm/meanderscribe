% Plots the ternary tree as done by Witkin 1984, Figure 4
%
%   plot_witkin( REGIONS ) plots the scale space regions bounded at the top
%   by the singular point where the defining zero crossing lines emerged,
%   at the bottom where another singular points splits a region in three,
%   on the sides by the positions where the zero crossing lines leave the 
%   scale space plane. REGIONS is generated by the function
%   scale_space_tree.
