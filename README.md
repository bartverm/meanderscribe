# meanderscribe
Matlab scripts to study the multiscale structure of meandering planforms 

These functions implement the methods explained in the following manuscript:

Vermeulen, B., A. J. F. Hoitink, G. Zolezzi, J. D. Abad, and R. Aalto 
        (2016), Multi-scale structure of meanders, Geophys. Res. Lett., 43,
        doi:10.1002/2016GL068238.

You can try out the functions by running the example.m script in the example folder. This script will run the analysis on the Mahakam planform as done in the paper.
